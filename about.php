				<p>I'm Katy. I'm not a special millennial who founded a successful start up at 25 years old - but I'm also not a lazy fuck millennial (I actually haven't met too many of those, I'm skeptical of their perceived proportion). I'm out to make my dream of becoming a successful programmer real while balancing a pretty awesome personal and family life.</p>

				<p class="big-text margin-top">Food.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I love to eat and feel better when I'm eating healthy. I buy a lot of premade meals and snacks, but I also cook small/easy meals for my husband and I when I find time. I'm definitely not fancy cook - instead I try to make things that are easy and healthy.</p>

				<p class="big-text margin-top">Life.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Living a simple life is key to me. The easier I can make my life, the less stress I feel and the happier I am.</p>

				<p>I do my best to do my part in making a better life for future generations by avoiding meat and educating myself on every aspect of life. I believe our generation's culture will have a huge impact on the future so I do my best to do what's right.</p>

				<p>I also try to go on adventures when I can, whether it be in the neighborhood or to new places.</p>

				<p class="big-text margin-top">Love.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Love fills my life. My husband and I are newly married after 5 years of being together and I love every minute of it. I'm so blessed to have an amazing, intelligent, and creative person like him as my life partner.</p>

				<p>Love for my family also brings me happiness. I have a great, supportave, and loving family from both Ron's side and mine.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Of course, my life isn't perfect. It's a constant struggle to keep it together. But the positivity is what keeps me going day after day.</p>
